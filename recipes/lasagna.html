      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
      <li>1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>

        1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste
      </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
      <li><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium
        heat until well browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season
        with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian
        seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1
        <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
        hours, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
        noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
        with cold water.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
        tablespoons parsley, and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon salt.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        To assemble, spread 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups of meat sauce
        in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise
        over meat sauce. Spread with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of the
        ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.
        Spoon 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups meat sauce over mozzarella,
        and sprinkle with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
        Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking
        spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for
        an additional 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
